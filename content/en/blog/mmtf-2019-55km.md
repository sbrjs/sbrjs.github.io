After 1 year, I'm back to MMTF again, and this is also my only ultra race in 2019.
Well, I can say, this is my most unprepared ultra race, due to busy with works _(and lazy üòÜ)_.

I reached run site at 6pm, from KL.

Is very crowded in race entry pack collection.

![MMTF](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/13-25-55km.JPG)

3 of us, 13KM, 25KM, 55KM _(is me üòâ)_.

![MMTF mandatory items](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1738.jpg)

Check the mandatory items checklist, then I only noticed

![Salomon soft flask](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1740.jpg)

It's Salomon, I thought it will be long lasting. But who knows, I only use a few times, in ultra race.
Initially I prepared total 1.5 litre of water, but now only left 1 litre ü§®

## Race day

This year start at morning, which I feel way better than last year _(start at 9pm)_.
More fresh and not as tired as last year.

From starting point to CP1, I noticed 1 of my trekking pole cannot be locked.
So I only use 1 pole, and carry the other pole until CP1. My aunts and friends are helper in CP1,
then I just passed the unused pole to them. Of course, 2 poles are better, but no choice, I didn't check earlier üòÖ

In CP1 here, the banana are whole piece, quite a lot of food there, but I only ate 1 banana, and don't feel like eating much.

Not stop too long, and continue move on to CP2.

![MMTF race](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1750.jpg)

This year trail is much dry and not slippery compared to last year.

In this route, is quite tough for me, I guess probably is because I lack of training.

![MMTF CP2](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1752.jpg)

This is memorable place, last year I DNF here. I took 6 hours to reach this CP in 2018.
But this year, I took 4:40+ _only_. Also, the COT for this year is 6 hours, 30 minutes longer than last year _(was 5:30 hours)_.

![MMTF CP2](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1755.jpg)

![MMTF CP2](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1754.jpg)

![MMTF CP2](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1756.jpg)

Hungry already. The banana are cut into half _(in CP1 was whole piece)_.
I ate 1, then no more. LOL. Then I eat cake

![MMTF CP2](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1757.jpg)

From CP2 to CP3, is the longest, and toughest, so I think I need 1.5 litre of water.
But there didn't have small bottle, ended up I need to carry the whole bottle, in hand, along the journey ü§¶

I was plan to DNF at CP3 (Angkasa), because I think, I totally no training for this race, it should be quite impossible to complete ü§î
So, I walk a while, sit and rest for a while, walk, sit, walk, sit... for don't know how many KM...

In around 900m elevation, I thought is reaching the peak soon, so I rest less, and keep walking. In fact, I walked for quite long time, then only reached

![Bukit Larut TM tower](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1758.jpg)

Finally, reached the TM tower, from here until CP4, all the way tar road ü§©

![Nutrilite protein](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1762.jpg)

Refill with Nutrilite protein üòç

Walking in tar road is quite comfortable. Soon, reached CP3

![MMTF CP3](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1763.jpg)

Reached CP3, I have 2 hours buffer, so I think I should be able to finish the race.
Drink some hot coffee, eat some cake, then move on...

![MMTF CP4](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1767.jpg)

I think CP3 to CP4, I took around 2 hours, 10KM, all the way tar road, and going down hill

![MMTF CP4 dinner](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1768.jpg)

![MMTF CP4 dinner](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1769.jpg)

![MMTF CP4 dinner](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1770.jpg)

This is my dinner, it looks simple, but very delicious. Was very hungry

I took rest, and dinner around 30 minutes. Then depart again on 7:40pm.

Now CP4 to CP5 need headlamp already. And also going back to trail üò©

I started to feel tired again, some more night time hard to see.
The given time for this is 2 hours, but I have 1 hour+ buffer.
It took me about 2:30 hours to reach CP5.

![MMTF CP5](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/IMG_1772.jpg)

CP5 is actually CP2, the same place. When reached CP5, there has no food, only drink, so I didn't stop for long, because the time I feel like a bit tight.

From CP5 to finishing line, I saw the elevation profile, seems not very high.
In fact, I was super tired, and hiking up, even though is not that much of trail.

At the end, reached finishing line at 12:30am, total 16.5 hours, which is 30min before COT. Is quite hard to believe I make it, without training üòÇ

![MMTF result](/en/blog/mmtf-2019-55km/result.PNG)

When reached finishing line, only get a medal, and a finisher T.
Nothing much else, and I straight away go back home, because really tired.
Long time didn't push my body to such an extend.

## Conclusion

Actually, this time I can complete, **LUCK** is 1 of the _key_, because the day before the race, has no rain, during the race day, no rain, and no hot sun, super nice weather.

I think, if raining that day, I may be DNF again. Thanks god üòå
