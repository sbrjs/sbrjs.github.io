This is the very first time I travel to foreign country alone. Also my first race in outside of Malaysia.

## The why

After my [first ultra 50km in Sungai Lembing](/2016/08/28/king-of-sungai-lembing-2016-50km/) back in 2016, I was thought of increase the distance.
But then I know, I've no enough time to do much training, so I don't plan to go for 100KM.

I found this race in Facebook, and it has 66KM category, which fulfill my requirement. Then I decided
to go alone _(travel alone was one of my reason too)_

## What I have done before the race

In September 2017, my last trail running _(about 8KM)_ before the race. Until 15 October, I joined
road race 30KM, I think this consider my LSD before the race, the result was bad, but a good LSD
for my leg to get used to long distance. In between, I totally no run/jogging at all.

## Pre-race

I arrived Chiang Mai Internation Airport on 2nd Nov morning.

I took Grab car to the hostel, rest for 1 day before going to race.

Then travel around the nearby area by bicycle for the whole afternoon.

Of course, foot massage is a must!!

## The event period

### Race pack collection

I waited the shuttle van in Arcade bus terminal.

![The event crew](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4725/38493415134_e035cf51bf_b.jpg)

![Register my name](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4689/38493414154_d096afc238_b.jpg)

Because the hotel nearby the race venue already full, thus I only book the camp site

![Camp](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4643/38493407534_dd5d04ebbb_b.jpg)

With the help of the other 2 runners...

![Camp done](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4597/38493400394_49a792cd5a_b.jpg)

![Queen Sirikit Botanic Garden](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4645/27424806469_f7baff16a4_b.jpg)

Just walking distance

![Checklist](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4688/24339523387_730fc3cca0_b.jpg)

Yeah!! My lucky number

![Race bib](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4738/24339506037_29eeb0e927_b.jpg)

![Finishing line](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4731/24339500997_e7fb5d84fc_b.jpg)

Not finish yet :)

![Salomon](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4641/39173094132_3ca5625cd8_b.jpg)

One of my favourite brand

![race briefing](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4737/38493310884_93e2a68cfa_b.jpg)

This is what they provide for dinner

### The race day

My category started from 8am, I wake up at 5am++

![Nutrilite protein & BodyKey](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4595/38493267874_b2167c92bc_b.jpg)

Actually, this suppose to be my breakfast, but I wake up too early. Thus this won't last so long for my stomach.

From the QSBG to the starting point, actually have about 1-2KM distance, thus I waited at the gate there,
and follow someone _(stranger)_ car go up.

![The runners waiting around](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4734/39173021602_90f39c2c03_b.jpg)

![The race route](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4729/38493254004_c25f3030f6_b.jpg)

![The race site](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4725/38493241534_e55155043d_b.jpg)

![Breakfast again](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4633/39172958872_e226972cc3_b.jpg)

I felt hungry before the race, thus I order the fried instant noodle.
They wanted to treat me _(because I only have THB1000 and they don't have small change)_, ended up I manage to change
with another runner, and paid for the meal. Is very hard to find such a good heart guy.

![Super sayan](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4645/25335099918_0ab57f34d7_b.jpg)

I guess you know who's this right? It's Super sayan Goku :)

![wefie with Goku](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4689/39200319061_4093e0d859_b.jpg)

I think is not easy to wear such a costume and run for 66KM...

![Starting point](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4692/27424648939_b387c567af_b.jpg)

![Race route](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4726/38323907155_e92b86a218_b.jpg)

At the beginning, we start from road

![Race route](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4739/38493149144_269f3184cd_b.jpg)

![Turning to trail](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4682/24339330427_ca6e58b623_b.jpg)

I used 46 minutes to complete 4.95KM. Quite slow though

![CP 1](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4682/24339324717_f79ce41e60_b.jpg)

Quite a short CP, the next station around 3KM only

![Pong Yaeng trail view](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4690/25335063008_74afa7cee6_b.jpg)

![Pong Yaeng trail view](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4736/38323886975_0330a6f467_b.jpg)

No rush, just enjoy the race. Be present...

![Pong Yaeng trail view](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4590/38323885615_83de531a97_b.jpg)

Can see from here, the trail is not tough at all, it's kind like a road run.

![Pong Yaeng trail view](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4681/25335048618_c534de337c_b.jpg)

One thing I like about trail ultra is, there will be many villeges to cross through, and see their living

![CP 2](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4600/25335028098_5a5c5eae2d_b.jpg)

Reached CP2

![CP 2](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4725/24339290027_5c7d801a8a_b.jpg)

Scanning the bib

![CP 2 food](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4634/38492043344_b27729e41f_b.jpg)

The food give really nice, here's the pineapple, and already cutted into piece.
I never seen this in Malaysia race so far.

![After CP 2](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/792/40928734792_eca7c06875_b.jpg)

Begin the journey again, it's very hot, steep. But again, the trail _(or road, I don't know)_ is pretty easy

![Pong Yaeng trail view](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4783/40928733692_1813b67d4b_b.jpg)

Aiming for podium is always not my style üòÜ

![Pong Yaeng trail view](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/805/40928732932_ccee1165dc_b.jpg)

![A6](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4772/40928732882_49cb4f9f4b_b.jpg)

Yeah, still early

![A6](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/806/40928732192_c0a3dcb965_b.jpg)

![A6 food](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/815/40928732362_e293fffb10_b.jpg)

The food given, it's pork rice, non-halal food. This won't happen in Malaysia race

![Pong Yaeng trail view](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4779/40928731712_1f24d370b1_b.jpg)

Finally, here look like trail already.

![Pong Yaeng trail view](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/792/40928730742_aeec2bc102_b.jpg)

![Pong Yaeng trail view](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/783/40928728022_0918a635eb_b.jpg)

Come back to road again

![A5](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/818/40928726812_28b04279d4_b.jpg)

About 5 hours passed, 42KM left

![A5](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/801/40928726012_ef562c9bc0_b.jpg)

![A5 food](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/811/40928724842_d60e2a73fb_b.jpg)

![A5 food](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4788/39161773140_8bf235d096_b.jpg)

Very nice service

![A5 consume protein & bodykey](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/795/39161771840_fef842f984_b.jpg)

I have my own, Nutrilite. To fill up the protein, mineral & vitamin

![Pong Yaeng trail view](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/822/40928720382_512818ecc3_b.jpg)

![Pong Yaeng trail view](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/807/40928715952_ac1f4e5e2a_b.jpg)

I think for normal travellers, won't come to this villege if they visit Chiang Mai.
This is why I like about trail ultra.

![A4](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/792/26099021457_d7b85bd690_b.jpg)

Reached A4

![A4 food](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4781/26099016887_95559a677e_b.jpg)

I've never seen this in Malaysia race too.

![A3](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/809/40970473581_7b9a5eb669_b.jpg)

Finally, reached the drop bag station.

![A3](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4788/40970473281_9297b70c30_b.jpg)

![A3](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/810/40970472741_13ce7ee8f7_b.jpg)

![A3](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4786/40970472521_56b5f5f3f7_b.jpg)

![Met Goku again](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/806/40970471851_8f6f159555_b.jpg)

Hmm... I'm about the same pace with Goku. Am I fast?

See the runner in front? She's another Malaysian who join the 66KM category.
66KM only she & me, 2 Malaysian.

![A2](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/811/39161708140_e732c52d92_b.jpg)

From A3 to A2, I follow other runners, and turned into wrong way,
I think wasted about 20~30 minutes there.

That time I still don't know how to use Suunto for navigation, although I loaded the route into it.

Somewhere in the middle, the wind very strong, and it sound like ghost crying, and the grass very tall, a bit scary feeling üò±

But it's really awesome experience to me ‚úåÔ∏è

![A2 food](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4778/40970752091_9a3b4fb517_b.jpg)

Here is very cold, eat some hot food really fantastic, they provide Laksa here too.

![A1](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/793/40970750181_a7bec14686_b.jpg)

Reached the last CP already, 11KM left. I stay for quite short time here, and then continue moving to finishing line.

![Queen Sirikit Botanic Garden](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/820/40970748571_edd01d78b1_b.jpg)

Reached the gate of the garden already. Tired and excited ü§©

Although reaching soon, but again, I gone into wrong route again.
The funny thing is, there's another runner follow me üòÜ
So both of us running in the dark, and no other runners, no car, just a complete dark road _(not trail)_.

After some point, I felt something not right, how come no other runners here?
Then I decided to make a U-turn, and that time I was far in front of the unlucky runner.
Until I saw him, I told him _"mai cai thini..."_ with my broken Thai language üòÖ

I think also wasted about 20~30 minutes here.

![PYT finishing line](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/803/40077397115_515fc203b3_b.jpg)

Then finally, I was 30 minutes before the DNF. I think that time was around 12:30am GMT+7.

![PYT finishing line](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4781/27099995118_03b77b055a_b.jpg)

![PYT finisher T-shirt](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/820/27099991268_9cb3ee991a_b.jpg)

The medal is handmade by their local people there, so special.

## After race

The story not end yet...

I was stay in the tent previously, suppose after the race, I have to go back to the tent, and bath for cold water _(night time really super cold)_.

But, remember the Malaysian runner same category to me?
They rented a resort, and I just follow her to the resort üòÅ
Super friendly, and very comfortable, especially after a long race.

![Pong Yaeng resort](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4774/40970729351_335dc04ce5_b.jpg)

Have nice bed, nice shower

![Pong Yaeng resort](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4775/40970719441_ebba52804d_b.jpg)

![Pong Yaeng resort](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4781/27099993038_77a3c489d1_b.jpg)

I took the photo in the morning.

## Summary

For those newbie who want to try out ultra, can try this, because so far I think this is the easiest trail ultra I've ever join.

The organiser, the food given, is quite good. If you have more budget, better to rent a hotel or resort. Because it's really awesome to rest nicely after a long race üòâ
