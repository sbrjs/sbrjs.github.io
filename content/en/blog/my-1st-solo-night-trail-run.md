Why I have this thought? Probably I can say is some stress & thinking chaos. Last night I have less than 5 hours of sleep, and some other issues caused me to rush here rush there. Also, skipped lunch and went for a seminar _(to duty)_.

Hungry... Tired... Cold _(the air cond)_... Other things on hand... I can't get my mind cleared. Thus, I decided to try something I never done before â€”â€” have a short run in Bukit Gasing.

Before that, I was thinking whether to go or not, or just take a rest... Then I know the **FEAR** is stopping me, my little voice is stopping me... I know the principle is, the more you fear, the more you must go for it! YES ðŸ’ª , then I go back and change clothes, bring my Black Diamond headlamp, change to trail running shoes, just as minimal as possible.

Of course, I put Allano lotion in my body, because I know there will have a lot of mosquito

Then, I went Bukit Gasing after having my dinner.

No one is hiking there, and is very dark inside the trail. Not complete dark because of moonlight

After taken some photos, I run in straight away. Because if I doubt for longer time, the bigger fear I have!

I follow the usual route that I know, because too many routes inside _(I get lost a few times when I was hiking in the morning)_. Night time none of single person is inside other than me, so I must be very be careful, because if I get lost, no one will point me the correct direction.

Of course, I have some experience running in the dark in trail, during ultra trail event. But this is different, no one in front of me; no one behind of me; no one in left or right besides me, quite scary also.

During the run, I felt a bit tired when going up hill. But I didn't stop at all, at most is slow down a bit, my mind is pretty clear, only one thing â€”â€” **_to get out of the trail_**. I didn't turn my head left or right, not even turn back, I don't care what is behind me, I only look in front, 1 meter in front, seldom look further distance. What I take care of is, 3~4 steps in front of me. From here, I understand a word â€”â€” **FOCUS**. I seldom so focus before. Is the FEAR make me focus, make me neglect of pain & tire...

Once I get out of the trail, I felt relieved. Once I reached home, I felt relax~ Really a great experience from this.

After workout, sure need to take protein for faster recovery
