This is my 3rd year joining full marathon in PBIM. The 1st time I completed in 5:08 hours, that time was running on 2nd bridge. Last year I completed in 6:23 hours, due to injured on my ankle, and lack of training. This year, my finishing time almost same as last year.

Early morning 9am+ I already reached the collection counter, that's why not many people there.

See what I have prepared...

![Running gears - Socks](https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5743/31252698336_1edfd06004_k.jpg)

Injinji socks. Because the 1st time I join FM, my toes feeling pain after some distance. This sock separate toes so that it avoid the problem.

![Running gears - Compression pant](https://c6.staticflickr.com/6/5606/31289214685_760e693e37_k.jpg)

A newly bought compression pant. I bought itduring the BodyKey event day. Quite good!

It's always good to spare some cash & phone. Because to me, I can't feel _safe_ if without cash ðŸ˜†

![Running gears - headband](https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5641/31174191571_3b03a92299_k.jpg)

I like this headband very much, it's soft, and it prevent my sweat come into my eyes. It's Compressport brand

![Running gears - GPS watch](https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5348/31289213755_fc979b1949_k.jpg)

10 years ago, people run with a normal digital watch with a basic timer. Nowadays I see many of athlete wearing a GPS watch.

I also using this to estimate my pace in order to complete before the cutoff time _(COT)_.

![Supplements](https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5512/31174224891_bcaadf151b_k.jpg)

Well, I can complete within the COT without much training, I think mostly is because of Nutrilite!

Here are Double X, Salmon Omega 3, All plant protein, BodyKey meal replacement & phytopowder orange.

My friend told me that his knee feeling a bit pain before the race start. But he is showing the **OK** sign _(see his right-hand)_, that means no problem ðŸ¤”

![Pre-race](https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5528/31289206795_51bab18052_k.jpg)

So many people joining FM, can see that FM is not as hard as you think ðŸ˜‰

![Pre-race almost start](https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5658/30921044950_0e54662987_k.jpg)

My stomach was not feeling well after around 8km, this was the same mistake I made last year â€”â€” eating too much before the race...

Same like last year, I started to walk after 8th km. Walk-run-walk-run~ feel like want to vommit also, very uncomfortable.

![Going up the bridge](https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5567/30921044170_dec36d56cc_k.jpg)

Until going up the bridge, it was 18-19th km, my stomoch feeling better at that time. But feeling sleepy and leg muscle start feeling pain. I think this is because of not training well.

![Half of the bridge](https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5480/31289201675_875e1a025a_k.jpg)

Getting less and less people here, because most people already running in front, and we're left behind ðŸ˜…

![Consume supplements](https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5673/30921043260_988aa80ed1_k.jpg)

After digested my dinner, it's the time to re-fuel with protein & BodyKey.

![Powered by Nutrilite](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5456/30481345953_ddfec3f05c_k.jpg)

Yeah!!! I also prepared Phytopowder orange 2 sticks. Around 26 or 27km I drink while running/walking, that moment my leg muscle was tight. Until 30 or 31km, my leg feeling relief. Phytopowder is so powerful!!! I think is because of electrolytes, it's very helpful.

This is the time to come back from the other side of the bridge

![On the way back from Butterworth](https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5490/31252682346_3975730a19_k.jpg)

A lot of people walking slowly, and me too

![Started to see 10km runners](https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5565/30921038410_3b8911dc63_k.jpg)

This is intersection point with 10km runners, suddenly become so many people.

![Mission completed](https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5544/31252680296_e2172cb5bb_k.jpg)

In the last 3km, I saw the _6:30_ balloon coming from my back. Omg, my target was to faster than last year, so I keep pushing myself without stop running _(the pace is around 8min/km+-)_. I really wish the balloon man can stop running for a while, because my leg very tired already. That moment has an evil-me & angel-me fighting in my mind. No choice, still have to push, I told myself: _persist 1 more km, I can do it_

Woo hoo!! At the end, I follow the _6:30_ balloon man cross the finishing line. **06:31:33** when I take this photo.

![Finishing medals](https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5606/31144818472_34310fd0d9_k.jpg)

Another friend of mine, also completed his 2nd FM.

![All of us got the medal](https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5737/30481317023_31d72d63b8_k.jpg)

Remember the red-tshirt guy? He told me his knee pain. Guess what? He completed in 5:40++ hours. And this is also his first FM.

The pink t-shirt guy is running HM, hopefully next year can see him in FM.

![Post-race recovery](https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5478/31174194071_69b6c87478_b.jpg)

After the race, I have Nutrilite protein for my recovery.

![Steps of the day](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5647/31174189761_1fd85efaf0_b.jpg)

In that day, I have total 64k+ steps, almost same as last year.

## Summary

Back in year 2014, I was so excited when I completed my first FM. Now, this is my 3rd times, before the race I already know I sure can complete within the COT, so the excitement level is not that high.

I believe everyone has a target to pursue. Just like 3 years back, my target was 42km; now, I'm looking towards ultra race in 2017!

_You can have a meaningful life if you have a dream to pursue_ ðŸ˜Ž
