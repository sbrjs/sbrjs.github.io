### What makes me join this run?

At the beginning of 2016, I wrote down some resolution for this year. One of them is to complete an ultra-marathon. Any marathons that more than 42km are consider ultra.

The moment I really get the mood in was, after I completed my first Triathlon, then I immediately survey for any ultra run which around 50km to 60km.

My first choice was, Cameron trail run 60km, unfortunately by the time I want to register already full. Then finally I chosen KOSL.

### A day before the race

![Receive race bib](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8308/29672412305_2e1be5d2ae_b.jpg)

Preparing items for the race. Before this race, I not training actively, like 1 or 2 weeks run 10km only. So I’m quite nervous for this, at the same time also excited!! As I’m going to complete 1 of my 2016 resolution.

Item I bring:

- Sun glasses
- Hydration pack
- Blinker _(is not really necessary here, because the race started at 7am)_
- Some chocolate _(in case hungry)_
- headband

### During the race

So it’s a trail run, 30km+ is off road

![Cross river](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8282/29561301822_f3416a34ca_b.jpg)

Cross the first river, this river must walk carefully, so that the shoes won’t get wet.

The distance is getting far between runners

![Cross river](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8069/29047825143_1c57877d4c_b.jpg)

Where to cross? In fact, my shoes get wet here! Initially I was thinking whether or not to take off my shoes and walk over the river, but I saw everybody just cross like that, then I also follow… WET

This is the first water station which has food, coke, 100-plus, but no cup is provided… I just bring a bottle with plain water, so if next time any of you want to join the race, please bring 1 more cup

This is the main checkpoint for 50km runner, must reach before 1pm, otherwise will be DNF. I reached here around 12pm.

### The result

48km+ is because we skipped the scenery hill, due to safety issue _(raining that time)_

![Certificate](https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8175/29047868333_aacf94b61b_b.jpg)

- **Category rank:** 48/69
- **Overall rank:** 88/121
- **Finishing time:** 2016-08-28 15:47:38
- **Total time:** 08:47:38

### What I learnt from this race

A **few items are needed** for this race

- Cap (because the weather will be hot, so a cap can cover eyes & face)
- Extra 1 or 2 pairs of socks (I cross the river and my socks wet, I have to use it until the end of the race, what if it is 100km?)

**Practice fast walk**. This is learn from an experienced runner Rambo. This is because most of us (may be not you) cannot run non-stop until the finishing line, so walking is 1 of the key skill to survive until the finishing line. So, walk more…

**Find a buddy if you’re not a podium runner**. This is a mental game, some time walk with someone is better than alone, at least he/she can encourage & motivate you. Also can get to know a new friend.

### Conclusion

Even I’m less training, but I do keep my diets, at the end still manage to complete within the cut off time.

If you thinking to join for a full marathon or even 50km, I encourage you to register first, then training later.
