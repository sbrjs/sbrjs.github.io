This is my second time visiting Indonesia. Which also a hiking (or more accurately trekking) trip.

## Day 1:

Wake up at 4:15am, take a 5am bus to KLIA2. Not sleep in the bus.

When reached KLIA2, meet-up with my aunt. After had some light breakfast, we proceed to baggage check in. I noticed now is self serve, have to weight the bag ourselves, scan the tag, and must make sure it match with the booking number. So, always reach airport earlier, we never know what will consume our time.

Everyone can fly

When in the airplane, I not really sleep well, even though I was tired.

When reached Surabaya airport, The first thing I do is, connect airport WiFi ðŸ˜†.
Then I saw a message from company ðŸ˜©, what to do? So I still bought a SIM card there.

We met with the tour guide and follow the van (or bus, not sure) to Banyuwangi. I was told, to the destination need around 7 hours. That time was 11:30am. Then I expect should be around 8pm can reach the hotel, then we have around 3 hours+ to sleep.

No fried rice, no fried noodle, only has _economic rice_.

The price is really economic, but the taste... so so only...

Finally... Arrived the hotel

From airport 11:30am, to the hotel 9:50pm ðŸ˜± Super long journey

During the journey in the bus, is hard for me to sleep, and I not even sure if I had take a nap. Because of the shaky bus and narrow space.

The good news is, now we can rest; but, the not so good news is, we will be checking out on 12am ðŸ˜¨.
After shower and unpack some stuff, 10:30pm. 1.5 hours left. ðŸ˜°

## Day 2

Alarm rang. 12am, I was super tired ðŸ˜´
After waiting all members ready, almost 1am. I think because of my tiredness, Iâ€™m able to nap for a while when travelling to Mount Ijen.

We were given a gas mask, for the sulphur smoke, which is very poisonous.

Is very crowded, and the trail was quite slippery. When hike down to the blue fire place, the trail is a bit dangerous.

We can see the fire, it just like the cooking gas fire. The smoke can make our throats dry and eye quite painful.
