I've been rest a while from race after [PBIM 2016](/2016/11/27/penang-bridge-international-marathon-2016/). Thus, I have a bit tension before the race. Another thing is, I have not much training, usually just 10k on weekend. But I have confidence to complete within cut off time :)

![Race mandatory & optional items](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2938/33386800002_39633bc553_b.jpg)

This is what I prepared for the race.

I dinner at 7pm, about 6 hours before the race. I ate _maggi goreng chicken chop_, quite a large portion. Until 10pm, I drink 2 scoops of All plant protein, Double X 1 set, Salmon Omega 3 one, get myself prepared.

I arrived race site at 11pm, went there early as I not very sure about the location, also not sure how long the mandatory items check it takes.

Lot's of people over there already. Just the time I reached there, one of the 250KM runner just left the check point _(the runner completed 200KM, left 50KM to go)_. A little while, the champion of 200KM runner arrived, he is really awesome, completed in 29hr++.

![Briefing](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2891/33386804392_63047ae9da_b.jpg)

Before the race we have a briefing, I heard the director said that some participants don't bring torch light/headlamp, which not fulfill the mandatory items requirement. This is not a usual marathon, thus it has specific requirements.

![Starting race](https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3767/33543896095_d6ef3d1242_b.jpg)

50KM category started at 1am, and the cut off is 10am.

Starting of the race, it's raining, then I put my headlamp under my cap _(because I read the review that black diamond headlamp is not waterproof)_.

![Check Point 1](https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3674/33160112060_3fbcaf72ba_b.jpg)

From start until CP1 _(9KM)_, my average pace is around 6-7 min/km, I just take 2 pieces of watermelon & 2 small cups of soft-drink.

![Check Point 2](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2852/33160115620_b8b2f035ae_b.jpg)

Then continue to CP2 _(in KM 14.5)_, using about the same pace like CP1, which I felt quite a short distance :)

Actually I didn't know there is a cut off time for every CP, because in [King of Sungai Lembing](/2016/08/28/king-of-sungai-lembing-2016-50km/), there is only 1 cut off in one of the CP. But still, I was 45 minutes ahead the cut off :)

The challenge comes up in KM 18... I felt a bit hard to breathe, and my heart not feeling comfortable as well. I open up the 2 clips of my hydration bag, and started to walk in average speed. I kept looking for the next CP, unfortunately I didn't see any... still in complete dark in front of me _(because CP area has some lights)_

Until KM 22-23, the road is downhill, then I run a little bit, walk-run-walk-run... Finally saw CP3, which is in KM 25, the U-turn point.

I rest in the CP3 for around 30 minutes. I ate 2 bananas, a few pieces of watermelons and refill some water. After rest, I felt better, then continue to run 4KMs, because I know that from CP3 to CP4 _(now going backward)_ is 10.5KM, so I still have a lot of time. Then I continue to walk-run-walk-run...

In KM 32, I felt hungry already, then I drink 1 sachet of BodyKey meal replacement, it can last me for a while. Is great to have it.

![Check Point 4](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2875/33160114150_57f82aafe6_b.jpg)

When I reached KM35, the time was 6:23am, 52 minutes ahead the cut off.

Can see the view along the way is quite nice.

![Check Point 5](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2865/33160114980_797c37c507_b.jpg)

Reached CP5, 1 hour ahead the cut off, not bad to me :)

![Phytopowder](https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3837/32729072443_354462782f_b.jpg)
But when I reached here, not much fruits left, so I just fill up some water and make Phytopowder to drink. It contains electrolyte...

![Last 9KM](https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3836/33386802072_80e36d7a91_b.jpg)

9KM left... Although is not long, but the final 5KM, my leg getter heavy, very hard to run already...4KM...3KM...2KM... Then I met a 100KM runner, he also cramp already, so I walk with him until the last 500 meters, then he started to run! OMG... I tried to run, but my calf & ankle kept sending me a signal, saying that if I continue to run, I will cramp... No choice, I walk until the last 100 meters, then run to the finishing line XD

Quite satisfied with my result :)

As I know I lag of training, but I'm sure I can do it better if have proper training.

### Summary

I have a thought to sign up 100KM, but luckily I didn't. Because this time 50KM is my limit already, I was quite tired on this race. So I sign up for 100KM, I think I will DNF.

So if the foundation is not strong enough, better don't go for something unachievable. Foundation is very important, get more training!
