I begin writing [my technical blog](http://jslim.net) since 2012.
My initial motive to write down what I've learned, was for me to refer back the solution when facing the same problem.
After some time, I found that there are some audience visit my blog posts, and commented with some thank you note.
This make me begin to love writing. I wanted to share more üòÅ

This blog will be more on my personal journey.

Well, I'm a web developer, a casual athlete _(running, swimming, hiking, trail running, sometime cycling)_. Most of the posts here are about sport activities.
