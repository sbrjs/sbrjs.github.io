## My running gears

![Salomon S-lab sense 6](/img/items/salomon-s-lab-sense-6.jpg)

I've been wearing this to the
[TITI 50KM](/2017/03/19/titi-ultra-2017-50km/),
[Penang Triathlon](/2017/04/26/penang-triathlon-2017/), 
[Penang ECO 50KM](/2017/05/15/penang-eco-100-2017-50km/), 
[Cameron ultra 50KM](/2017/07/24/cameron-ultra-trail-2017-55km/), 
Pong Yaeng Trail 66KM,
[MMTF 70KM](/2018/12/01/mmtf-2018-70km/). 

It's pretty good in trail, but not so in road. Because the shoelace I can pull it tight easily, so it won't hurt my toe.

![Suunto Ambit 3 peak sapphire](/img/items/suunto-ambit-3-peak-sapphire.jpeg)

This is old model, the good about this watch is, it's longer battery life _(longer than Suunto Spartan series)_.
But the latest model GPS navigation is better than this.

![Injinji socks](/img/items/injinji-socks.jpg)

I've been wearing this socks to race since after my first Full marathon.
The good about this socks is, I can prevent friction in between my toes.

![Salomon S-lab Adv Skin 12](/img/items/salomon-adv-skin-12.jpg)

The good thing about this is, it pretty fit to my body.
During run, it won't shake here & there.
The compartments also very convenient to keep my items.

![Black Diamond Spot Headlamp](/img/items/black-diamond-spot.jpeg)

I bought in 2016 if I remember correctly.
With 200 lumens + 950 mAh AAA battery, can last for 5 hours, after 5 hours started to dim out.
If the race COT is tight, and need to run more than 5 hours in the dark, better to have spare headlamp _(not spare battery)_.
Because it's going to take some time to change the battery during dark.

![Salomon Gaiter](/img/items/salomon-trail-gaiters.jpg)

I've using this in Pong Yaeng Trail 66KM, 
[MMTF 70KM](/2018/12/01/mmtf-2018-70km/).
Especially in MMTF, such a muddy trail, with this gaiter, it prevent sand & mud into my shoes.

![Salomon XT Wings Glove WP](/img/items/salomon-xt-wings-glove-wp.jpg)

I like this glove because of the open fingers, I can still tap on my phone with finger.
Then can cover up my fingers if necessary. Quite convenient.
