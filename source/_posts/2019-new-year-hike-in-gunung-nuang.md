What people usually do in new year? Shopping, stay at home, etc.

This is not my first time hiking in 1st January.

I have been here 2 years ago, in Christmas day. Now come back again

We reached the entrance around 10:50am. Quite late and hot already.

To enter, have to register and pay RM2/person, I think is about the same as 2 years ago. Inflation affected here 😆

The beginning path, is _highway_, means car can pass through, wide & easy trail.

After about 5KM, then only reached the actual trail. We took around 1 hour+ to reach.

Begin to see waterfall here, there's a way to turn and cross over the waterfall, after a short distance from the entrance.

Waterfall along the way. Here the elevation all the way up

There are few mini rivers, but cross over confirm shoes will get wet.

There's a rope there, quite easy to cross over

Took 3 hours+, finally reached the Kem Pacat. 2 years ago I also hike until here.
Today also the same.

We took a short break here _(around 15 minutes)_, eat some bread and have some energy drink.
It's important to have some food & drink, to refuel 🍩 🍸

I thought going down-hill should be faster, but end up, about the same like up-hill.

Here to wash face to cool down the heat _(afternoon hike, heat is normal)_

Finally, about 5 hours to come back the the _highway_, 4KM around 2 hours going down-hill.
Fast? Slow? Doesn't matter, just enjoy the hike.

After the long _highway_...

Finally, we back the the entrance. Here's **_after_** photo. Smile or cry 🤣

Remember to checkout when back to the entrance, they need to ensure everyone are safe.

## Summary

Hiking can be one of the good choice in festive season

- not as much people like shopping mall
- strengthen our muscle
- breath some fresh air outside of city

If you are first timer, and plan to go Nuang, you can try to go until Kem Pacat.

6 hours should be quite standard speed, and prepare

- more water, 1.5 litre / person should be enough.
- some food, no need too much, can be some energy food or bread good enough.

_P/S: I'm not reached the summit, so I think 1.5 litre may not enough for some people if hike to summit, especially in hot weather._
