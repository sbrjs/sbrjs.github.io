Until‚Ä¶ The race director shout ‚Äúfaster! faster! still have 10 minutes!!‚Äù<br>Then I only notice, I‚Äôm 10 minutes before the COT. My first time ever, in CP1 didn‚Äôt have much time left <em>(usually I will reach around 1 hour before the cut off)</em>.</p><p>Just continue to slow jog. Because from CP1 - CP2, the beginning path is tar road.<br>After I think around 1KM, we go into trail again, and this time tougher‚Ä¶<br>Until a point, I heard someone shout ‚Äúwrong way! wrong way!‚Äù, I just follow the front runners most of the time.<br>But when I heard this, I check with my GPS map, it really shows I‚Äôm out of the route, so have to U-turn back, I think around 100 meters, luckily is not too far yet‚Ä¶<br>So, here start going uphill, continuously‚Ä¶ And I begin to feel tired, sleepy.<br>I‚Äôm very bad in late-night running. Some more, I woke up so early in the morning and didn‚Äôt sleep in afternoon.<br>Then I keep stop and sit down <em>(can‚Äôt remember how many times)</em>, really tired.<br>The ‚Äúgive up‚Äù start to popup in my mind. Then I keep telling myself, I must take a 10-15 minutes nap when I reached CP2.</p><p><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4829/44336216120_852b5775a3_b.jpg" alt="MMTF 2018: CP1 - CP2"></p><p>The <em>undertaker</em> is coming up, because is close to the COT already.</p><p>The trail is very slippery &amp; muddy. I holding 2 sticks is like doing skiing, but this is not snow, it‚Äôs mud‚Ä¶</p><p>I started to realise, the runners in front &amp; behind of me are the same, means we‚Äôre in the same pace.<br>Until around 17KM, my headlamp getting darker, just last around 5 hours, then I change the battery in halfway.<br>When changing battery in dark, a bit difficult too. Because when turned off the headlamp, can‚Äôt see anything at all.<br>From here, I notice 1 set of spare battery is not enough, better to prepare 2 set spare battery for 1 night.</p><p>By this time, I heard some runner said ‚ÄúLagi 40 minit‚Äù, means 40 minutes left to the COT. And I still have 2~3KM‚Ä¶<br>Tired + sleepy, I know not enough time already, but still have to continue, because there‚Äôs no other way out to the trail.</p><p><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4887/45429429924_78bd2d2755_b.jpg" alt="MMTF 2018: Reached CP2"></p><p>I‚Äôm 35 minutes over the COT, my very first time DNF <em>(did not finished)</em>, I also can‚Äôt imagine just in CP2, already DNF.<br>This race, need to train very well, not only lower body, upper body also need to train well.<br>There are some path has rope for us to pull.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why I have this thought? Probably I can say is some stress &amp; thinking chaos. Last night I have less than 5 hours of sleep, and some other issues caused me to rush here rush there. Also, skipped lunch and went for a seminar <em>(to duty)</em>.</p><p>Hungry‚Ä¶ Tired‚Ä¶ Cold <em>(the air cond)</em>‚Ä¶ Other things on hand‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt get my mind cleared. Thus, I decided to try something I never done before ‚Äî‚Äî have a short run in Bukit Gasing.</p><p>Before that, I was thinking whether to go or not, or just take a rest‚Ä¶ Then I know the <strong>FEAR</strong> is stopping me, my little voice is stopping me‚Ä¶ I know the principle is, the more you fear, the more you must go for it! YES üí™ , then I go back and change clothes, bring my Black Diamond headlamp, change to trail running shoes, just as minimal as possible.</p><p>Of course, I put Allano lotion in my body, because I know there will have a lot of mosquito</p><p><img src="/files/posts/my-1st-solo-night-trail-run/images/allano-lotion.jpg" alt="Allano lotion"></p><p>Then, I went Bukit Gasing after having my dinner.</p><p><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4437/36360312866_18bbfab794_z.jpg" alt="Gasing entrance"></p><p>No one is hiking there, and is very dark inside the trail. Not complete dark because of moonlight</p><p><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4347/36268330071_ec9331bcc4_z.jpg" alt="Full moonlight"></p><p>After taken some photos, I run in straight away. Because if I doubt for longer time, the bigger fear I have!</p><p>I follow the usual route that I know, because too many routes inside <em>(I get lost a few times when I was hiking in the morning)</em>. Night time none of single person is inside other than me, so I must be very be careful, because if I get lost, no one will point me the correct direction.</p><p>Of course, I have some experience running in the dark in trail, during ultra trail event. But this is different, no one in front of me; no one behind of me; no one in left or right besides me, quite scary also.</p><p>During the run, I felt a bit tired when going up hill. But I didn‚Äôt stop at all, at most is slow down a bit, my mind is pretty clear, only one thing ‚Äî‚Äî <strong><em>to get out of the trail</em></strong>. I didn‚Äôt turn my head left or right, not even turn back, I don‚Äôt care what is behind me, I only look in front, 1 meter in front, seldom look further distance. What I take care of is, 3~4 steps in front of me. From here, I understand a word ‚Äî‚Äî <strong>FOCUS</strong>. I seldom so focus before. Is the FEAR make me focus, make me neglect of pain &amp; tire‚Ä¶</p><iframe height="405" width="590" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" scrolling="no" src="https://www.strava.com/activities/1120136713/embed/33f0eef016bc55ef62634241164989199a6415cf"></iframe><p>Once I get out of the trail, I felt relieved. Once I reached home, I felt relax~ Really a great experience from this.</p><p>After workout, sure need to take protein for faster recovery</p><p><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4348/36360311536_5ab019b87e_z.jpg" alt="Nutrilite for recovery"></p><p>#nutrilite #salomon #suunto #compresssport #blackdiamond</p>]]></content>

He told me 6KM left, gambateh~ And I‚Äôm the last 1 <em>(among our team members)</em> until this CP.

In this part, my leg felt better when up hill, I also don‚Äôt know why. So I overtake some runners here, including one of my team member <em>(met at CP7 that guy)</em>, he asked for chocolate from me, and I just finished it. LoL~</p><p>So I didn‚Äôt stop, and keep walking, until CP3, I saw not much volunteers there, and the gate also closed, then I didn‚Äôt stop as well, because about 1KM left to the finishing line.</p><p>Walk‚Ä¶ jog‚Ä¶ walk‚Ä¶ jog‚Ä¶ Finally‚Ä¶</p><p><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4292/35734251380_25920fc0e1_z.jpg" alt="Crossed the finishing line"></p><p>Yeah!!!

A lot of up hill, also a lot of down hill, and steep.

OMG!!</p><p>Want to call taxi? NO! There is middle of hill, shouldn‚Äôt have taxi to come up I guess.

Then I saw some runners sleep there <em>(there is a basketball court)</em>, so I also slept for a moment <em>(not really sleep also, just for my mind &amp; eye to rest)</em>.</p><p>The moment when I woke up is already 6:30am, but I felt fresh and energized üí™ . So I started to run slowly, the 6.7KM along the way is road, so great!!</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4179/33876809053_1038ea69c3_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP7 ~ CP8"></p><p>Have great scene along the way</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4189/33876808963_0f2470ac53_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP7 ~ CP8"></p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4168/33876808893_4300f1a682_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP7 ~ CP8"></p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4181/33876808673_1cc59c38df_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP7 ~ CP8"></p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4192/34646158726_9bc968db95_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP7 ~ CP8"></p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4181/33876808473_13fa6ae124_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP7 ~ CP8"></p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4187/33876807943_c260c42a85_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP8"></p><p>Reached CP8 at 7:35am. The next CP is 7.9KM away, not too far, not too near also‚Ä¶</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4177/33876807843_77dbee6e40_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP8 ~ CP9"></p><p>After CP8, going to trail again‚Ä¶ I was scared, so just continue to walk, no more run here üòÖ</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4171/33876807403_4d535f9793_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP8 ~ CP9"></p><p>You can see is getting up hill here</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4160/34646148136_6340d83c25_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP8 ~ CP9"></p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4176/33876807273_21a085cc3f_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP9"></p><p>My thigh is quite painful now. But the next CP only 3KM away. so sit for a moment and continue~</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4185/33876807073_dd85863e8a_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP9"></p><p>The 3KM trail‚Ä¶ like this</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4173/34646153206_ea9192a40c_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP9 ~ CP10"></p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4157/33876806473_474af5bed1_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP10"></p><p>Reached CP10 at 12:22pm, which took me about 1.5 hour.</p><p>In this CP, they provide main food like fried noodle and nasi lemak. I heard some of the runners said want to give up, actually still have time. But I think may be they are too tired. One of the runner even said this is harder than <a href="http://borneoultra.com/tmbt1/">TMBT</a>. Again, I consumed Nutrilite supplement here again üòé</p><p>Well, I‚Äôm pretty confident that I‚Äôm able to finish it now. Move on‚Ä¶</p><p>This is the hottest time now, I somehow felt dehydrated. Hike until halfway, I started not feeling well again. So I sit down and closed my eye, rest my mind, for about 5 minutes. Surprisingly, I felt refresh again. COOL~~</p><p>I think probably is my luck this time, the sky suddenly turn dark, is like going to rain soon. But until I reached CP11, still no rain. Really nice weather, awesome!!</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4169/33876806063_cf38f5d220_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP11"></p><p>I reached CP11 at 3:30pm, still 4.5 hours to reach the finishing line, about8.1KM. Pretty much time now. So I take my time, and rest here.</p><p>I started to walk at 3:45~3:50pm, again‚Ä¶</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4182/33876805903_b62ab9e687_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP11 ~ finishing"></p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4157/34646151256_7294e846a5_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP11 ~ finishing"></p><p>The path mostly like this, pretty easy to go. Of course, there are up &amp; down hill as well.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4161/34646150586_cc57953434_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 CP11 ~ finishing"></p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4162/34646150306_8429926c53_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 finishing line"></p><p>YEAH üôå ‚úåÔ∏è üòé finally I reached the finishing line‚Ä¶ My watch showing the time 6:10pm! The feeling was really awesome!! First time ever I run <em>(hike)</em> such a long hours, compared the my previous record, was 10hr 40min. Really really a big breakthrough to myself.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4158/34646150006_112a3be03f_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 finisher medal"></p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4177/34646149376_4f89ec3405_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 finisher medal"></p><p>And here is the official result</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4169/34556085031_1ab34fbbc2_z.jpg" alt="Penang ECO 100 result"></p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>As I mentioned above, this was  my first time every to run such a long hours, and I was not prepared well for it too. So I learned that, take a nap can actually recover some energy. Of course, with the help of Nutrilite supplement too.</p><p>Before the race start, I consumed 1 sachet protein &amp; 1 sachet of BodyKey meal replacement, plus Double X, B, E, Q10 &amp; Glucosamine. My body status was: 56.8kg, 13.2% body fat, BMI 17.5, 1.5% visceral fat.</p><p>During the race, CP6<del>CP7, CP9</del>CP10, CP10<del>CP11, CP11</del>finishing line, each path I consume 1 sachet Phytopowder orange, to reduce the chance of cramp.<br>At CP7 &amp; CP10, I consumed Double X 1-set, E &amp; Glucosamine.</p><p>After the race, I consumed 2 sachets of protein, Double X, B, E, Q10 &amp; Glucosamine, Cal Mag D. Then after a day, I checked my body with Karada scanner: 57.1kg, 9.7% body fat, 17.6 BMI, 1.0 visceral fat.</p><p>How great is this, after the race I still gain some weight üòé</p><p>I guess this would be my toughest race in 2017. Probably I won‚Äôt join again if without proper training.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before I sign up for this, my bicycle was parking at home for long long time, I think, since I already bought the bicycle, then I must go for race. Otherwise will be wasted. Thus, I signed up.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2819/34244267086_95c1544eec_b.jpg" alt="Race bib"></p><p>I think this is my lucky number.</p><p>After race bib collection, there is a dinner &amp; briefing at the night before the race. I met a few friends during briefing. One of them asked me, <em>‚ÄúHow was your training?‚Äù</em> I told him, <em>‚ÄúI almost no prepare for it, due to busy of work.‚Äù</em></p><p>It‚Äôs true, that‚Äôs why I said before sign up, I was considering‚Ä¶</p><p>Before the race, I did only 1x pool swimming üèä  (about 1km I guess), 2x cycling üöµ  (23km &amp; 15km), running also stopped for few weeks after TITI ultra 50k.</p><p>I noticed the cutoff time was 5 hours. Because last year <em>(PGiTD 2016)</em> was 5:30 hours‚Ä¶ so I was a bit worry about that. Last year my result was almost 5 hours, and also, I did more training compare to this year. So? Theoritically I suppose to take longer time to complete the course than last year right?</p><p>One of my buddy that I met him in PGiTD 2016, he told me to <strong>enjoy the race</strong>. Wow~ so I got it‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs enjoy it</p><h2 id="Race-day"><a href="#Race-day" class="headerlink" title="Race day"></a>Race day</h2><p>Early morning I went to the race site from Bayan Lepas, so I 4:30am depart, as it took about 1 hour to travel from the place I stay. Then I reached at 5:30am, so I still have some time to get my bike ready, drink protein &amp; bodykey, take some supplements‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs my light breakfast</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4157/34154004861_3d6a0fc7bc_b.jpg" alt="Check in bike"></p><p>Then went to check in the bike</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2811/34284769855_0f66541541_b.jpg" alt="XDS"></p><p>The blue XDS is mine</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4177/34284763915_64fb6cea88_b.jpg" alt="walk to shuttle bus"></p><p>Then have to walk about 500 meters to take the shuttle bus to the swim site.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2835/33474619553_a871e67153_b.jpg" alt="Go down from shuttle bus"></p><h3 id="Swim"><a href="#Swim" class="headerlink" title="Swim"></a>Swim</h3><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2843/34244259966_4d02a9c7e6_b.jpg" alt="Check in swim transition bag"></p><p>This is the place where we hang our transition bag according to our bib number</p><p>The swimming part is divided into 2 loops, 750 meters each. During the first loop, so many swimmers was kicking here and there‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not so used to it, and then I slow down and let others go first‚Ä¶</p><p>2nd loop, was smoother as getting less and less swimmers already.</p><p>When I get up, I heard someone said they get stung by jellyfish üò± . Luckily I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2862/34244257696_1e248b6a1a_b.jpg" alt="stairecase shortcut"></p><p>After swim, we have to run about 2.5km back to the transition area to take our bike <em>(is a bit different from other triathlon)</em></p><p>According to the organiser, this is the shortcut that ready for us to get there.

The <em>GO</em> way, beginning was up hill, not that tired actually, not so steep also. It‚Äôs fun when going down hill. Then in kampung area about 10km also, is flat road.</p><p>Then the challenging part has come‚Ä¶ After U-turn to the <em>BACK</em> way, when I reached the up hill‚Ä¶ hmmm‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like hell! So damn tired, my leg. I felt like very long hours there, and very long journey!!! But, I didn‚Äôt stop along the way, I just keep telling myself, later down hill is my rest time.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I‚Äôve been rest a while from race after <a href="/2016/11/27/penang-bridge-international-marathon-2016/">PBIM 2016</a>. Thus, I have a bit tension before the race. Another thing is, I have not much training, usually just 10k on weekend. But I have confidence to complete within cut off time :)</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2938/33386800002_39633bc553_b.jpg" alt="Race mandatory &amp; optional items"></p><p>This is what I prepared for the race.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3671/32699985794_50a9cb9b38_b.jpg" alt="Nutrilite all plant protein before race"></p><p>I dinner at 7pm, about 6 hours before the race. I ate <em>maggi goreng chicken chop</em>, quite a large portion. Until 10pm, I drink 2 scoops of All plant protein, Double X 1 set, Salmon Omega 3 one, get myself prepared.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2943/33386808062_9a40d21fc9_b.jpg" alt="On the race site"></p><p>I arrived race site at 11pm, went there early as I not very sure about the location, also not sure how long the mandatory items check it takes.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2837/33543893235_b5431fae28_b.jpg" alt="Race site"></p><p>Lot‚Äôs of people over there already. Just the time I reached there, one of the 250KM runner just left the check point <em>(the runner completed 200KM, left 50KM to go)</em>. A little while, the champion of 200KM runner arrived, he is really awesome, completed in 29hr++.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2891/33386804392_63047ae9da_b.jpg" alt="Briefing"></p><p>Before the race we have a briefing, I heard the director said that some participants don‚Äôt bring torch light/headlamp, which not fulfill the mandatory items requirement. This is not a usual marathon, thus it has specific requirements.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3767/33543896095_d6ef3d1242_b.jpg" alt="Starting race"></p><p>50KM category started at 1am, and the cut off is 10am.</p><p>Starting of the race, it‚Äôs raining, then I put my headlamp under my cap <em>(because I read the review that black diamond headlamp is not waterproof)</em>.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3674/33160112060_3fbcaf72ba_b.jpg" alt="Check Point 1"></p><p>From start until CP1 <em>(9KM)</em>, my average pace is around 6-7 min/km, I just take 2 pieces of watermelon &amp; 2 small cups of soft-drink.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2852/33160115620_b8b2f035ae_b.jpg" alt="Check Point 2"></p><p>Then continue to CP2 <em>(in KM 14.5)</em>, using about the same pace like CP1, which I felt quite a short distance :)</p><p>Actually I didn‚Äôt know there is a cut off time for every CP, because in <a href="/2016/08/28/king-of-sungai-lembing-2016-50km/">King of Sungai Lembing</a>, there is only 1 cut off in one of the CP. But still, I was 45 minutes ahead the cut off :)</p><p>The challenge comes up in KM 18‚Ä¶ I felt a bit hard to breathe, and my heart not feeling comfortable as well. I open up the 2 clips of my hydration bag, and started to walk in average speed. I kept looking for the next CP, unfortunately I didn‚Äôt see any‚Ä¶ still in complete dark in front of me <em>(because CP area has some lights)</em></p><p>Until KM 22-23, the road is downhill, then I run a little bit, walk-run-walk-run‚Ä¶ Finally saw CP3, which is in KM 25, the U-turn point.</p><p>I rest in the CP3 for around 30 minutes. I ate 2 bananas, a few pieces of watermelons and refill some water. After rest, I felt better, then continue to run 4KMs, because I know that from CP3 to CP4 <em>(now going backward)</em> is 10.5KM, so I still have a lot of time. Then I continue to walk-run-walk-run‚Ä¶</p><p>In KM 32, I felt hungry already, then I drink 1 sachet of BodyKey meal replacement, it can last me for a while.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my 3rd year joining full marathon in PBIM. The 1st time I completed in 5:08 hours, that time was running on 2nd bridge. Last year I completed in 6:23 hours, due to injured on my ankle, and lack of training. This year, my finishing time almost same as last year.</p><p><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5748/31252706046_ef47305386_k.jpg" alt="Race pack collection"></p><p>Early morning 9am+ I already reached the collection counter, that‚Äôs why not many people there.</p><p><img src="https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5745/30467307974_788f893976_k.jpg" alt="Race pack collection counter"></p><p><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5556/30921046970_49e1bcec64_k.jpg" alt="Race bib"></p><p>My lucky number <strong>A00383</strong></p><p><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5783/30481315313_ab3ccf8a77_k.jpg" alt="Running gears"></p><p>See what I have prepared‚Ä¶</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5743/31252698336_1edfd06004_k.jpg" alt="Running gears - Socks"></p><p>Injinji socks.

Nowadays I see many of athlete wearing a GPS watch.</p><p>I also using this to estimate my pace in order to complete before the cutoff time <em>(COT)</em>.</p><p><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5512/31174224891_bcaadf151b_k.jpg" alt="Supplements"></p><p>Well, I can complete within the COT without much training, I think mostly is because of Nutrilite!</p><p>Here are Double X, Salmon Omega 3, All plant protein, BodyKey meal replacement &amp; phytopowder orange.</p><p><em>You can reach me on my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jsify">Facebook page</a> and PM me if you want to know more.</em></p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5830/30921046040_89850d84be_k.jpg" alt="Pre-race"></p><p>My friend told me that his knee feeling a bit pain before the race start.

But feeling sleepy and leg muscle start feeling pain.

I also prepared Phytopowder orange 2 sticks. Around 26 or 27km I drink while running/walking, that moment my leg muscle was tight. Until 30 or 31km, my leg feeling relief. Phytopowder is so powerful!!! I think is because of electrolytes, it‚Äôs very helpful.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5566/30921041160_3cd58d32d2_k.jpg" alt="On the way back from Butterworth"></p><p>This is the time to come back from the other side of the bridge</p><p><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5490/31252682346_3975730a19_k.jpg" alt="On the way back from Butterworth"></p><p>A lot of people walking slowly, and me too</p><p><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5565/30921038410_3b8911dc63_k.jpg" alt="Started to see 10km runners"></p><p>This is intersection point with 10km runners, suddenly become so many people.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5544/31252680296_e2172cb5bb_k.jpg" alt="Mission completed"></p><p>In the last 3km, I saw the <em>6:30</em> balloon coming from my back. Omg, my target was to faster than last year, so I keep pushing myself without stop running <em>(the pace is around 8min/km+-)</em>. I really wish the balloon man can stop running for a while, because my leg very tired already. That moment has an evil-me &amp; angel-me fighting in my mind. No choice, still have to push, I told myself: <em>persist 1 more km, I can do it</em></p><p>Woo hoo!! At the end, I follow the <em>6:30</em> balloon man cross the finishing line. <strong>06:31:33</strong> when I take this photo.</p><p><img src="https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5760/30921030490_4ed28f3d59_k.jpg" alt="Finishing medal"></p><p>Mission completed!!! again‚Ä¶</p><iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/788038984/embed/a55d2cb881f0d6e5ca6d79e5016d6228cb601c6f'></iframe><p><img src="/files/posts/penang-bridge-international-marathon-2016/images/pbim2016-medals.jpg" alt="Different category medals"></p><p>This year we have different size of medals ‚Äî‚Äî <strong>S</strong>, <strong>M</strong>, <strong>L</strong>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my 3rd time sign up triathlon race.</p><p>The first time was on 2015, Penang Triathlon 2015. That time I borrow a very old mountain bike <em>(break system also not that good)</em> from my uncle, borrow helmet from a friend. Is like, not well prepared and just go for it. Unfortunately, on the event day, after check in my bike, I fell down and get my ankle injured. At first, I insist go to the swimming side, and try to swim a while, but was too pain, so I give up the race. My first time to give up a race‚Ä¶</p><p>After rest for 6 months, I sign up Port Dickson Triathlon 2015. Thought this time I will complete, but too bad, that time was hazy, and I withdraw again.</p><p>On the same year I bought a road bike, and some necessary equipments, then sign up Penang Triathlon 2016. Then‚Ä¶</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/373/32601394902_6c7666a980_b.jpg" alt="Get ready"></p><p>This time I came alone, stay on 1 of my relative house, in Sungai Ara. The event place is on another side of the island. So need to wake up early and go to the place.</p><p>First, of course check in the bike at the starting point.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/442/32601394542_5da726c379_b.jpg" alt="Bike check-in"></p><p>Then there is a shuttle bus to send all participants to the swimming area, I think around 2-3km.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/299/32601393962_47f8105044_b.jpg" alt="The swimming area"></p><p>First time swimming in the sea, the key is to cool down, don‚Äôt get panic. Because when I started to run into the sea, I felt my Qi is not enough and used up easily. After a while, I keep calm and slow down, is getting better. Swimming part is 2 loops triangle, each ~750m far.</p><p>After swim, by right should be cycling section. But this is different, we have to run from the sea side to starting point, around 2-3km.</p><p>Then the hardest part is cycling <em>(to me)</em>. May be is because of I not get used to cycling, some more the route has lots of uphill &amp; downhill, but is a very awesome experience. I almost cramp at first 5km of cycling, then I get down and rest for a while, and continue‚Ä¶ Total distance 40km, go 20km, then U-turn 20km. The challenging part is after U-turn, a long journey of uphill, but I don‚Äôt have cramp feeling anymore.</p><p>The final part is to run 10km. Although 10km is not long, but I walked a lot, instead of run. Met a new friend there and he walk/run together with me, so we finish almost the same time.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/622/32374875210_cd9c57cc8f_b.jpg" alt="The finishing line"></p><p>During my run, was heavy rain, that‚Äôs why whole body get wet.</p><iframe src='https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/embed/1131238027' title='Penang Triathlon 2016' width='465' height='634' frameborder='0'></iframe><p>First triathlon completed in almost 5 hours. To me, I‚Äôm satisfied with the timing, because I‚Äôve no proper training for this, and still completed within the cut off time <em>(5:30 hours)</em>. And compare with last year.</p><p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/608/32601396082_79a26317db_b.jpg" alt="2015 vs 2016"></p><p>I already better than myself last year.</p>]]></content>
